Testing if a new release is ok with the sample example:

1/ Download the correct sample example output: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jp24184zony1977/correct_output.zip?dl=1
2/ Unpack it
3/ Run the new release on the sample data
4/ Compare the two outputs like:
    diff -rq <correct_output> <output_new_release> | grep -v ".png" | grep -v ".log.txt" | grep -v "visualisations/index.html"
5/ If this previous command does not output anything, then it is fine
