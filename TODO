General TODO:
  -newick file should be optional (R script and software)
  -treat NA better
  -if we want to show only figures from the software, and not the one I customized in cytoscape + inkscape, we should definitely add some insights of the annotation.

Low priority:
    - When the strains input file is missing, we return an error:
        [FATAL ERROR] Error opening file
        Could it be a little more detailed? Eg, which file (there are two inputs), and whether the format is wrong or the file was not found.
    - possibility to work on unitig counts rather than presence/absence


Annotation TODO:
    -We should propose it optionnally or even better : from the result web page, as it should take quite a while to blast
     all the selected unitigs (if we propose it from the summary index page, we could have the possibility to select only
     some components we want to annotate, and not all, and launch the annotation on these components.)
    - as the ncbi blast cgi service prevents from launching too many queries, we should launch only one big query on all
    selected component's unitigs and parse the results.
    - ideally, we should be able, as a result of the annotation, to add 1) an annotation summary of the component on the
    index page (for example, the gene name or region description that appears the more often, like on the first scheme
    drawn of the index page), + 2) when clicking on the component, a detailed annotation (per unitig) should be available
    on the component page. For example, the one you proposed : a toogle list of (cleaned) annotations, and when we click
    on a particular annotation this highlights the nodes concerned by the annotation (highligh could be done by selecting
    the nodes for instance).
    - technically, we saw that a correct annotation can be parsed from the blast output, following one or two well chosen
    links). However, we looked at the blast result web page and not at the cgi query content. Maybe this will differ a
    bit. I have good knowledge of perl which is cool for parsing, but not as efficient as python for performance... I also
    know several ways to query ncbi properties. I don't know your knowledge on it, and if you would need help on this.
    - Blast the genes of the nodes and show a view with the genes and which unitigs belong to each gene









Misc:
Installing zlib (only for compiling):
   sudo apt-get install libgcrypt11-dev zlib1g-dev
